# AI-Powered-Product-Recommendation-System-with-RAG
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based recommendation system using a FastAPI backend and a React frontend. The system provides AI-powered product recommendations based on user queries, leveraging semantic search for retrieval and LLM-based augmentation for enhanced descriptions of recommended products.

## Tech Stack
